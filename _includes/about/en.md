Thank you for stopping by to check out my blog. I am Saurabh Joshi & I am going to maintain this blog to record my learnings in technology & my thoughts on self improvement & life in general. I was born in Mumbai and spent most of my life there but from past many years I have been living & working in Singapore.

IP networking has been my bread and butter for many years but I am longing to become an all-round Systems Engineer. Currently I enjoy reading & labbing about Network Programmability, Software Defined trends in networking, Linux, Scripting and open source softwares; & I am trying to ride this curve one bit at a time.

I enjoy teaching and sharing my learnings with others, and that is what I will try to do in this blog.
