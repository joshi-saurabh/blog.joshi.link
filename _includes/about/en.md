I am Saurabh Joshi, a Network Engineer by profession & I currently live in Singapore. I chose this discpline in 2007 after graduating from the university when I took amy first job as technical support engineer at D-link. Since then, I have worked in various capacities in organizations ranging from managed service Providers like NTT,BT & WWT and at financial institutions like Deutsche Bank & Credit Suisse. 

Networking is my bread and butter but I am longing to become an all-round Systems Engineer. I am fascinated with Network Programmability, DevOps, Software Defined Networking, Linux, scripting and Open Source Softwares & I am trying to ride the learning curve one bit at a time. 

I always had a calling for teaching and like to share my learnings with others. That is what I will try to do in this blog.
