## Expand Your Umwelt

Recently I came across a YouTube video in which a neuroscientist David Eagleman is presenting fascinating new technologies which will allow disabled people to get their missing senses like hearing, seeing and allow them to actually 'feel it' in their brain.

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/4c1lqFXHvqI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1lqFXHvqI "Video Title")

In the video at one point David Eagleman talks about how a missing sense deprives one of a portion of an 'Umwelt'; or how adding a new sensory organ expands his/her Umwelt. While the german word m Umwelt, when translated on Google, simply means environment; it has bigger meaning. It means what 'your' senses allow you to see & experience & only that is your world !

We humans are capable of sampling only a tiny fraction of electromagnatic spectrum which allows us to see certain colors or listen to only a certain audio frequencies. Humans' visual and auditory world is constrained by what we can sample. On the other hand, there are some animals who can see much bigger or smaller spectrums or have completely a different sensory organ which we do not posses at all. For eg. a small bird called European Robin has a apparatus in his head that allows him to 'see the earths magnatic field' which he uses to navigate his routes during migration. All that bird has done is attached a new peripheral device to same brain which you and me have.

You can watch the above video, it talks about lots of other things. But it got me thinking about how this relates to our everyday lives. We as IT engineers (or anyone else) too can benefit from such expansion of our 'Umwelts'. I experienced the power of it recently.

For long time I was siloed in a mindset of a network engineer, convinced that the IP networking is all that I need to know. After all I am a network engineer & my Umwelt consisted only that. But in last couple of years I started to make an effort to be friends with Linux. I aspired to be able to manage my own servers for soemtime and I realized that the skills gap I had was huge. So I started picking up bits and pieces of Linux administration slowly by reading books, watching videos and following blogs.

It was kind of boring and aimless journey initially but I pushed myself to stay the course and complete the books just for the sake of it, just be in the game and not retreat. Down the line, I became fairly fluent with Linux OS's ways of working.

This year, I got interested in writing (after dreaming about it for long long time). So I started researching ways to setup my blog & got convienced that a LAMP stack is all I need to get my blog running. I bought my own domain name and enrolled for a udemy course which taught me how to install LAMP stack (with Nginx instead of Apache). And while I was watching that course and at the same time adding pieces to my project, I realized that this time all the linux OS administration concepts I was struggling with in the past, are coming to me like second nature. My neural pathways were becoming thicker! 

This gave me a sense of how a delayed gratification feels like & I loved it. The last time I underwent such a journey was when I studied for CCIE. Back then every topic on a blueprint would give me such a rush & overtime my mind adapted to ways of IP networking. Over next few years I would learn and unlearn lots of network technologies which were needed for my day job easily.

Although learning network concepts was easy, I realized that to master things which were not related to my Umwelt at all (Linux administration, Programming, Web developement etc.) are much harder. And the only way to ride that curve is to put in little effort over long time until you have really created that new fold in your brain! After that anything thats related to this acquired 'new sense' becomes easier to grasp. 

Imagine if you have only a monochrome vision like some animals do. How boring the world would look? Just add few more colors to your eyesight and the beautiful colorful world appears in front of you. There are animals that can see in infrared or like the european Robin who can 'sense' the magnatic waves maye have much beautiful worlds than us. 

We too can strive to add new colors in our life? How? How about learning musical instruents, learning a new language, Reading, Writing, Excercising, Cooking, Practicing any form of art, volunteering for some cause, having a pet, nurishing any other hobby, learning to trade to name a few;  or anything that you never did so far in your life?  

Adding just one such shade to you palatte opens your mind to new possibilities, new dimensions of world, new paradigms which were never accessible to you before. But now you have created a new fold in you brain & thickened some more neural pathways. You have expanded your Umwelt a bit more & that's what enriches your life!
